  This library is based on several projects:

  AT24C1024 EEPROM library for the Arduino found here:

  The Arduino EEPROM library found here:  
  http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/EEPROM

  The 24C256 library found here:

  From the datasheet:

  The Atmel¨ AT24C512C provides 524,288 bits of Serial Electrically Erasable and
  Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) organized as 65,536 words of eight bits
  each. The cascadable feature of the device allows up to eight devices to share a
  common 2-wire bus. The device is optimized for use in many industrial and commercial
  applications where low-power and low-voltage operation are essential. The devices are
  available in space-saving 8-lead JEDEC SOIC, 8-lead EIAJ SOIC, 8-lead TSSOP,
  8-pad UDFN, 8-ball WLCSP, and 8-ball VFBGA packages. In addition, the entire family
  is available in 1.7V (1.7V to 3.6V) and 2.5V (2.5V to 5.5V) versions.

  Address Map, and Storage Capability

  Address = A2..A0 P8..P0 B6..B0

  2^3 devices = 8 devices (A bits)
  2^9 pages = 512 pages (B pits)
  2^7 bytes = 128 bytes (B bits)

  2^16 bytes per device = 64 Kbytes per device
  2^19 bytes with all 8 devices = 512Kbytes max storage capability
